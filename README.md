# Cat - Dog Classifier

This code is written in Keras with Tensorflow Backend<br/>
It is a basic code that can differentiate between 2 categories: Cat and Dog<br/>
That's it. That's all it can do... Most of the time atleast...<br/><br/>
Code completed using: [Keras](https://keras.io/) with [Tensoflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) backend on Python<br/>
PS: I used the dog-vs-cat [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) on Kaggle
